# Statistical Analysis of Literacy Rates in India

## Overview
This project analyzes literacy trends across Indian states over multiple decades and studies how selected socio-economic factors are associated with literacy outcomes. The work focuses on applying statistical reasoning and regression analysis to real-world data.

## Objectives
- Analyze long-term trends in literacy rates across Indian states  
- Examine relationships between literacy and socio-economic indicators  
- Apply multiple linear regression to assess influencing factors  

## Dataset
The analysis uses state-wise literacy and socio-economic data collected over several decades.  
Variables include:
- Sex ratio  
- Population density  
- Poverty rate  
- Unemployment rate  

**Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository and was used locally in text format.

## Methodology
- Preliminary data organization and visualization using **Microsoft Excel**  
- Exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling in **R**  
- Multiple linear regression analysis  
- Interpretation of regression coefficients and diagnostic checks  

## Key Insights
- Literacy rates show substantial variation across states and time periods  
- Socio-economic variables exhibit meaningful associations with literacy  
- Regression results provide interpretable insights into influencing factors  

## Tools Used
- R  
- Microsoft Excel  

## Project Context
This project was conducted as part of academic coursework and focuses on developing practical skills in statistical analysis, data interpretation, and regression modeling using real socio-economic data.
